Converting pre-records into readable formats for AE/SV

Script converts heavily compressed video files (using ffmpeg) into readable formats suited for video editing. 

## Requirements
Download the script:
* [prorec.bat](https://github.com/gmzorz/prerecs/archive/master.zip) 

Required codecs & software:
* [Xvid](https://www.xvid.com/download/) (download & install)
* [quicktime](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL837) (download & install)
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/ffmpeg-20190207-7cab547-win64-static.zip) (navigate to the C:\Windows\System32 folder, open the ffmpeg zip file, go to the 'bin' folder, and extract all .exe files into the system32 folder)

## Instructions
Place prorec.bat in any directory containing the footage to be converted and run it. Drag & drop works, but does not support multiple files.
